title: "Logistic Regression"
description: |
  This is the coolest thing I learned last week: logsitic regression and hmm... looks similar to the IRT modeling equation (SUS!!). This is also for me to practice inserting equations into text like you would in LaTeX and doing fun things with the text.

Logistic regression is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) for response variables where MLR doesn't do well at all as in data that looks like this. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Logistic regression example from SPSS Tutorials"}
library(graphics)
library(bookdown)
library(knitr)

include_graphics("logistic-regression-scatterplot.png")

```

GLMs have a two-stage modeling process:

1. Model the response variable using a probability distribution
2. Model the parameter of the distribution by using a collection of predictors and special form regression

The outcome should be a 2-level categorical variable *Y~i~* that takes the value 1 with probability *p~i~* and value 0 with probability *1-p~i~*. The predictor variables are written as *x~k,i~* which is the value of variable *k* for observation *i*. For data that looks like the scatterplot above, we want to choose a transformation that makes sense a.k.a the **logit transformation**:

$logit(p_i)=log_e(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})$

The reason for this is because a linear model $y=b_0 + b_1x$, although easier to understand, does not accurately represent the relationship between $x$ and $Y_i$. We need a function of $p_i$ that can be translated into $y=b_0 + b_1x$ from the logit model and vice versa. Here is a graphic comparison of plotting $p(Y=1)$ vs $x$:

```{r logreg, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Graphic comparison between linear and logit models"}

include_graphics("LogReg_1.png")

```

Here's the algebra for getting the equation of the logistic function:

$f(p_i) = b_0 + b_1x$

$log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) = b_0 + b_1x$

$\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} = e^{b_0 + b_1x}$

$\frac{1-p_i}{p_i} = e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)}$

$\frac{1}{p_i} - 1 = e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)}$

$\frac{1}{p_i} = e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)} + 1$

$p_i = \frac{1}{e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)} + 1}$
