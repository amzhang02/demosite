```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

drivers <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/drivers.csv')
```

This is a graph of the number of world records each Mario Kart 64 player set over the years since its release in 1996. 

```{r, include=TRUE}
australian <- drivers %>%
  filter(nation == "Australia")

driver_numrecords <- ggplot(australian, aes(x = year, y = records, group = player, col = player)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
