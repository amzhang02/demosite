      "contents": "\nLogistic regression is a type of generalized linear model (GLM) for response variables where MLR doesn’t do well at all as in data that looks like this.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Logistic regression example from SPSS Tutorials\n\n\n\nGLMs have a two-stage modeling process:\nModel the response variable using a probability distribution\nModel the parameter of the distribution by using a collection of predictors and special form regression\nThe outcome should be a 2-level categorical variable Yi that takes the value 1 with probability pi and value 0 with probability 1-pi. The predictor variables are written as xk,i which is the value of variable k for observation i. For data that looks like the scatterplot above, we want to choose a transformation that makes sense a.k.a the logit transformation:\n\\(logit(p_i)=log_e(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})\\)\nThe reason for this is because a linear model \\(y=b_0 + b_1x\\), although easier to understand, does not accurately represent the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(Y_i\\). We need a function of \\(p_i\\) that can be translated into \\(y=b_0 + b_1x\\) from the logit model and vice versa. Here is a graphic comparison of plotting \\(p(Y=1)\\) vs \\(x\\):\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Graphic comparison between linear and logit models\n\n\n\nHere’s the algebra for getting the equation of the logistic function:\n\\(f(p_i) = b_0 + b_1x\\)\n\\(log(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) = b_0 + b_1x\\)\n\\(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} = e^{b_0 + b_1x}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1-p_i}{p_i} = e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{p_i} - 1 = e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{p_i} = e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)} + 1\\)\n\\(p_i = \\frac{1}{e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)} + 1}\\)\n\n\n\n",
